# Open Grok Bot

A local-first AI workspace for creating bot personas, chatting with models exposed through MUAPI, and keeping conversations on your machine. The interface is built with Next.js and React; the API is built with FastAPI and Python.

This is an independent open-source project and is not affiliated with xAI.

## What it does

- **Bot personas:** Create, edit, and switch between bots with their own role, system prompt, model, and visual identity.
- **Model picker:** Select model IDs from the catalog exposed by the FastAPI service. The default model is `grok-4-5`.
- **SSE chat:** Send a message, persist it locally, and receive `turn.started`, `content.delta`, and `turn.completed` events over Server-Sent Events.
- **Image attachments:** Upload JPEG, PNG, WEBP, GIF, or AVIF images. The backend sends them to the configured provider when possible and falls back to a local data URL for previews.
- **Markdown messages:** Render assistant replies as Markdown in the chat transcript.
- **Voice dictation:** Use the browser's Web Speech API when the browser supports it.
- **Approved workspace tools:** Explicit `/workspace list`, `/workspace read`, and `/workspace write` requests pause for user approval, stay inside `WORKSPACE_ROOT`, and produce audit events.
- **Governed action gateway:** Workspace actions use a structured request/result contract, a deny-by-default registry, approval state, and redacted lifecycle audit records.
- **Settings drawer:** Configure the MUAPI key, provider base URL, default model, Composio key, and local profile details.
- **Connector surface:** Browse a curated or live Composio app catalog, inspect connection status, and start OAuth authorization explicitly from Marketplace.
- **Read-only GitHub action:** After connecting GitHub, run an explicit issue lookup from chat and pass its structured result through the action gateway.
- **Approval-gated GitHub write:** Propose a GitHub issue from chat, inspect the repository/title/body-size preview, approve it, and receive a normalized issue result.
- **Audit trail:** Review local approval, workspace-tool, and connector events from the sidebar.
- **Computer provider surface:** Inspect a bot-scoped provider lifecycle, poll screen metadata, and run higher-risk provider actions through the same gateway used by tools.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- Python and pip
- A MUAPI API key for live model responses

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anil-matcha/open-grok-bot.git
cd open-grok-bot
```

### 2. Start the FastAPI server

In a terminal window:

```bash
cd server
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

export MUAPI_API_KEY="your_muapi_api_key"
python run.py
```

The API starts at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

API documentation is available at:

- Swagger UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

### 3. Start the Next.js client

In a second terminal window:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can also enter the provider key from **App Settings → Connections** after the UI loads. The environment variable is the server-side fallback.

The local server creates a mode-0600 session token in `DATA_DIR` and the browser establishes an HttpOnly session automatically when connecting from loopback. For a deployment accessed beyond the local machine, set `APP_AUTH_TOKEN` on the server and expose the same value to the client as `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN` through the deployment environment.

### Optional Docker computer runtime

The default provider is the deterministic local adapter. To enable real browser, terminal, file, input, and screenshot operations, build the pinned runtime image and opt in to the Docker provider:

```bash
docker build -t open-grok-bot-computer:1.62.1 ./runtime
export COMPUTER_PROVIDER=docker
export COMPUTER_DOCKER_IMAGE=open-grok-bot-computer:1.62.1
```

The Docker daemon must be running before starting the API. Each bot gets a separate container, a separate workspace under `DATA_DIR/computers`, an ephemeral loopback-only port, and an internal runtime token. The container root is read-only, capabilities are dropped, and CPU, memory, process, and shared-memory limits are applied. The current runtime provides browser screenshots and approved operations; human takeover and a desktop/VNC surface remain follow-up work.

This is a local development runtime, not a hardened hostile-web sandbox. Follow the [official Playwright Docker guidance](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker) and do not send untrusted websites or credentials through it until network egress, image provenance, and stronger sandboxing are reviewed for your deployment.

## Configuration

The client defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1`. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` if the API runs elsewhere:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1"
```

The server reads these variables from the environment:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MUAPI_API_KEY` | empty | Provider credential used when no key is saved in local settings |
| `MUAPI_BASE_URL` | `https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1` | Provider API base URL |
| `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` | empty | Optional connector credential used when no key is saved in local settings |
| `DEFAULT_MODEL` | `grok-4-5` | Initial model used for new settings and bots |
| `DATA_DIR` | per-user hidden app directory | SQLite database, migration copies, and local key location |
| `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | generated mode-0600 key in `DATA_DIR` | Optional Fernet key for encrypted provider credentials |
| `APP_AUTH_TOKEN` | generated mode-0600 token in `DATA_DIR` | Bearer token for non-loopback API access |
| `AUTH_SESSION_MAX_AGE` | `86400` | Session-cookie lifetime in seconds |
| `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE` | `0` | Set to `1` when serving over HTTPS |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | localhost and loopback client origins | Comma-separated browser origins allowed by the API |
| `COMPUTER_PROVIDER` | `fake` | Computer adapter: `fake` or `docker` |
| `COMPUTER_DOCKER_IMAGE` | `open-grok-bot-computer:1.62.1` | Pinned local runtime image |
| `COMPUTER_DOCKER_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | `DATA_DIR/computers` | Root for per-bot runtime workspaces |
| `COMPUTER_DOCKER_CPU_LIMIT` | `2.0` | Docker CPU limit per computer |
| `COMPUTER_DOCKER_MEMORY_LIMIT` | `2g` | Docker memory limit per computer |
| `COMPUTER_DOCKER_PIDS_LIMIT` | `512` | Maximum processes per computer |
| `COMPUTER_DOCKER_START_TIMEOUT` | `20` | Runtime readiness timeout in seconds |
| `COMPUTER_DOCKER_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` | `30` | Docker/driver operation timeout in seconds |
| `WORKSPACE_ROOT` | repository root | Maximum directory that approved workspace tools can access |
| `WORKSPACE_MAX_FILE_BYTES` | `131072` | Read/write size limit for workspace files |
| `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `120` | How long a pending approval remains open |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | FastAPI bind address |
| `PORT` | `8000` | FastAPI port |

The selected model ID is appended to `MUAPI_BASE_URL`. The configured provider must expose the expected endpoint and response shape for that model.

## App surfaces

| Surface | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Chat | Bot roster, model selection, Markdown replies, image attachments, voice dictation, and streamed responses |
| Computer | Bot-scoped provider lifecycle, screen metadata polling, and governed computer actions |
| Marketplace | Searchable curated or live app catalog with explicit connect/disconnect actions |
| Audit trail | Recent approval, workspace-tool, and connector events persisted by the local API |
| App Settings | Local profile values and MUAPI connection/model settings |

### Chat request flow

1. The client posts the user message to `/api/v1/chat/send`.
2. The server stores it in the local message store.
3. The client opens an EventSource connection to `/api/v1/chat/stream/{thread_id}`.
4. An explicit workspace or connector request becomes a structured action request and is checked against the deny-by-default gateway registry.
5. The gateway pauses the stream for approval when required, then executes the registered action.
6. The gateway emits normalized action lifecycle records; the client receives compatible tool events and the structured result.
7. The server sends the selected model, recent history, and tool result to MUAPI.
8. Provider output is forwarded as SSE deltas and the completed assistant message is persisted.

### Product direction

The prototype follows a local-first path: persistent bot personas and histories, explicit capabilities, user-visible approvals, provider flexibility, optional app connectors, and an opt-in isolated browser runtime. The next meaningful layers are durable memory and routines, voice input/output, human takeover, desktop/VNC presentation, background jobs, and authenticated multi-user deployment. They are intentionally documented as roadmap items rather than implied by the current UI.

### Approved workspace commands

These commands are intentionally explicit; arbitrary shell commands are not accepted:

```text
/workspace list [path]
/workspace read <path>
/workspace write <path>
file content on the next line
```

Paths must remain inside `WORKSPACE_ROOT`. Reads and writes are limited by `WORKSPACE_MAX_FILE_BYTES`, and every request/decision/result is recorded in the local audit store.

Connector actions are intentionally explicit:

```text
/connector github issues <owner>/<repo> [open|closed|all]
/connector github create-issue <owner>/<repo> <title>
optional body on the next line
```

The read action requires a configured Composio key and an active GitHub connection. The write action also requires an approval response. Results are limited to issue summaries; credentials and issue bodies are not copied into the action request preview or audit summary.

Computer actions are also explicit. Lifecycle controls use the authenticated `/computers/{bot_id}/...` routes and are recorded by the action gateway. Provider operations such as `terminal_execute`, `browser_navigate`, `files_list`, and `send_input` can be opened through `/computers/{bot_id}/actions`; higher-risk operations return a pending request until `/approvals/respond` allows them, then the matching `/actions/{request_id}/execute` route continues the action.

curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health
```

## Local data and secrets

On first start, the server creates a SQLite database under the per-user data directory defined in `server/app/config.py`. Bots, messages, settings, approvals, and audit events survive restarts, with schema migrations and a local owner identity tracked in the database. Existing JSON files are imported once and retained as migration copies; credential fields in the old settings file are scrubbed after import.

For local development:

- API routes require authentication. Loopback browser clients receive a session automatically; direct API clients can read `.auth-token` from `DATA_DIR` and send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- For non-loopback access, set `APP_AUTH_TOKEN` explicitly and configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN` or call `/auth/login` before using protected routes. Do not expose the generated token through logs or source control.
- Provider credentials are encrypted at rest with a mode-0600 Fernet key in `DATA_DIR`. Set `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` when the key must be supplied by deployment secrets or shared across restarts and hosts.
- Settings responses never return provider credentials. Enter a new value to replace a stored key, or leave it blank to keep the current one.
- Back up the SQLite database and encryption key together. If the key is lost, encrypted credentials must be entered again.
- Keep `CORS_ORIGINS` narrow and use HTTPS plus `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=1` outside local development.
- Never commit API keys, local settings, transcripts, or generated environment files.
- The repository ignores local SQLite files, encryption keys, `.env` files, virtual environments, caches, and build output.

## Limitations

The following surfaces are present but should not be mistaken for completed infrastructure:

- **Single local owner:** Authentication, bearer validation, and owner-scoped rows are present, but user provisioning, roles beyond the local owner, and multi-user grants are still pending.
- **Single-user local storage:** SQLite improves restart durability, but multi-user provisioning, backups, and multi-instance coordination are still pending.
- **Docker runtime is opt-in:** The Docker/Playwright provider and image are included, but live container startup depends on a running Docker daemon and a locally built image. The current runtime has browser screenshots and controlled operations, not a full desktop or VNC session.
- **No durable memory or routines:** Conversations persist, but there is no separate memory store, scheduled routine engine, or background worker yet.
- **No voice or multi-client apps:** Voice, desktop, and mobile clients are not included in this repository.
- **Workspace and computer tools are intentionally narrow:** Workspace commands support confined file listing, reads, and writes. Docker computer operations run in a bot-scoped container and require approval for browser navigation, terminal commands, and input; human takeover and unrestricted desktop control are not implemented.
- **Connector actions are intentionally narrow:** Chat currently exposes only GitHub issue listing and approval-gated issue creation. Dynamic tool discovery, arbitrary connector calls, and other connector writes remain roadmap work.
- **Provider streaming is adapter-level:** Depending on the provider response, the service may receive a completed result and emit it to the UI in small deltas.
- **No CI workflow is included yet:** Focused workspace, approval, auth, persistence, and provider tests are present, but broader runtime integration and browser tests remain to be added.

## Development

Available client scripts:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev       # Start the development server
npm run build     # Create a production build
npm run start     # Serve the production build
npm run lint      # Run the configured Next.js lint command
```

Run the focused backend tests with:

```bash
DATA_DIR=/tmp/open-grok-bot-test-data PYTHONPATH=server python -m unittest discover -s server/tests -v
```

When changing an API contract, update the Pydantic schema, router, client helper, tests, and this README together.

## Troubleshooting

### The UI says the API is offline

Confirm that the FastAPI server is running on port 8000, then check:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health
```

If the server runs on another host or port, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` before starting the client.

If protected API calls return `401`, confirm the browser origin is listed in `CORS_ORIGINS`. For non-loopback deployments, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN` when building the client or call `/api/v1/auth/login` first.

### The Docker computer stays unavailable

Confirm that the daemon is running, the runtime image was built, and the API uses the Docker adapter:

```bash
docker info
docker image inspect open-grok-bot-computer:1.62.1
echo "$COMPUTER_PROVIDER"
```

The API intentionally reports a failed Docker start instead of silently executing the task in the fake adapter. Keep `COMPUTER_PROVIDER=fake` when Docker is not available.

### The chat returns a provider error

Check the key in App Settings, verify `MUAPI_BASE_URL`, and make sure the selected model ID is supported by that provider endpoint.

### Image uploads do not produce a hosted URL

The backend falls back to a base64 data URL for local previews when no usable provider key is configured or the provider upload request fails.

## Contributing

Focused issues and pull requests are welcome. Before opening a change:

- Keep setup and behavior documentation synchronized with the code.
- Do not include secrets, personal data, or local transcripts.
- Explain changes to provider behavior, API contracts, or persistence.
- Run the client checks that apply to your change.
