"""Files a bot can hand to the user as a download card in the chat.

Two roots are shareable: the shared workspace the workspace tools use, and
the bot's own computer workspace (its /workspace, which in bind mode is a
directory under the API's data directory). A share never copies or moves
anything; it records a pointer the chat can download later, after the same
confinement checks.
